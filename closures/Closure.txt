Closures: A closure is an inner function that remembers and it has access to variables in local scope it was created even after the outer function has finished executing.
The criteria that must be met to create closure in Python are summarized in the following points.
•	We must have a nested function (function inside a function).
•	The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function.
•	The enclosing function must return the nested function.
•	def outer_func(message):

    def inner_func(msg):
        print(message)
        print(msg)
    return inner_func
a = outer_func("hii")
a("hi")  #a is inner_func. You can check by inner_func.__name__
a("hello")
